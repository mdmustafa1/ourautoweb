This is our auto web........
Hello everyone. This is a project which would automate everything after developer commits code in GIT Prerequities: GIT , Docker, ngrok and Jenkins should be pre installed You can check command and how to deploy the project at https://lnkd.in/gA6kvyD

Step 1 and 2 are used for auto pushing just after commit automatically. Step 4 is used to copy the files of repo in linux Step 5 is used to launch docker and share the files to docker Step 7 is used when Quality Assurance Department gives green signal to run the code in production world. In this step secondary branch will merge to master branch The project can be used to make production and testing system of code automatic and thus, will help in better and quick results I would like to Thank Mr. Vimal Daga and LinuxWorld India LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd for giving me right education to make projects like this. I hope I can learn even 10 percent what Vimal sir is teaching.
